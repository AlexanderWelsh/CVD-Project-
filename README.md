# A Statistical Analysis of Cardiovascular Disease and Possible Factors

## Overview
**Objective:**
This project is meant to determine what factors contribute to an increased risk of Cardiovascular Disease based on information gathered in a medical examination dataset.

**Tools used:**
- Myplotlib for data visualization.
- Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
- Scipy for statistical tests.
- Numpy for simple mathematical operations.
- Statistical analysis to interpret the data.


## Methodology

**Data cleaning:** The data was cleaned to remove dirty data such as translating age from days to years.

**Data visualization:** A data visualization was created to determine any patterns in the data.

**Statistical probability:** A T-test was used to determine if the data is statistically significant.

**Validation:** The statistical probability is used to determine if lower or higher data points correlate to having a higher chance of CVD.

## Conclusion 

  There are significant differences in several characteristics between individuals with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD). Age is a notable factor, with individuals with CVD being more likely to be older. Height and weight also show significant differences, as shorter and lighter individuals are more likely to have CVD. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels differ as well; individuals with CVD are more likely to have lower systolic blood pressure and higher diastolic blood pressure. Cholesterol and glucose levels are significantly higher in individuals with CVD. Additionally, lifestyle factors play a role, with people with CVD being more likely to smoke, consume alcohol, and engage in less physical activity. However, there is no significant difference in gender between those with and without CVD.

**1. Age:** There is a significant difference in age between people with and without CVD. A person with CVD is more likely to be older.

**2. Gender:** There is no significant difference in gender between people with and without CVD.

**3. Height:** There is a significant difference in height between people with and without CVD. Shorter people are more likely to have CVD.

**4. Weight:** There is a significant difference in height between people with and without CVD. A person with CVD is more likely to be lighter.

**5. Systolic Blood Pressure:** There is a significant difference in systolic blood pressure between people with and without CVD. A person with CVD is more likely to have low systolic blood pressure.

**6. Diastolic Blood Pressure:** There is a significant difference in diastolic blood pressure between people with and without CVD. A person with CVD is more likely to have high diastolic blood pressure.

**7. Cholesterol:** There is a significant difference in cholesterol between people with and without CVD. A person with CVD is more likely to have high cholesterol.

**8. Glucose:** There is a significant difference in glucose between people with and without CVD. A person with CVD is more likely to have high glucose.

**9. Smoking Habits:** There is a significant difference in smoking habits between people with and without CVD. A person with CVD is more likely to smoke.

**10. Drinking Habits:** There is a significant difference in drinking habits between people with and without CVD. A person with CVD is more likely to consume alcohol.

**11. Physical Activity:** There is a significant difference in physical activity between people with and without CVD. A person with CVD is more likely to be inactive.
